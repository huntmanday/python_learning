# Practicing Programming Fundamentals
I've made a firm decision for myself that in order to further my career, I MUST learn how to code.

Not with the goal in mind to be a super software engineer, but to at least get a firm understanding of the basics so I can fulfill the "Dev" part of "DevOps".

I've created this repository for me and my tutor (Charlie) to incorporate learning other useful tools I'll need to know in order to be eligible for future SRE job roles.
